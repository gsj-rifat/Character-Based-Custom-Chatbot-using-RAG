# Character-Based-Custom-Chatbot-using-RAG
This project builds a custom AI chatbot that answers questions based on fictional character descriptions using the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The dataset contains synthetic character data (names, descriptions, medium, and settings) and helps evaluate how well a chatbot can retrieve and generate contextually grounded responses.
